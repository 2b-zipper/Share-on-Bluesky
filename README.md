# Share on Bluesky
 Share current tab, links and selected text on Bluesky. Inspired by “[Share on Twitter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/share-on-twitter/gkjgmeeoldebbdoehhngapnlfmdbmiie)”.

 ## What's this?
 This is a chrome extension I created for my personal use around June 2024. I'm publishing it because I couldn't find anyone else who created a similar extension. I hope it will be useful to you !😉

## Features
This extension has almost or exactly the same functionality as Share on Twitter.
- Share the current tab on Bluesky
- Share links on Bluesky
- Share selected text on Bluesky
- Share images on Bluesky
- Choose to open the share window as a popup or a new tab
